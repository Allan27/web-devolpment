<h1>About Me</h1>


<p>

Hi I'm Allan Pinedo since I can remember. I love these three things: volleyball,video games and art.
<br>I started playing volleyball when I was 9 years old and it was because I saw this brazilian guy in the olympics destroying the opposite team.
<br> Since then I have said that I want to be like him and today I’m still chasing that skill level.
<br>Almost the same thing happens with video games that I have always loved. The fantasy world sometimes feels like I’m inside the game I love when I have those feelings.

My mom always told me that I have something special with art because since I was 4 years old I would spend the whole  day drawing.
I even think is true I’m always drawing always doing some kind of figure on a piece of paper.When I was in high school used to get in a lot of trouble because I would spend the whole class drawing.
The feeling that you can create your own world with it own character it just amazing.I have dream that I’m still chasing that is to create my own comic so that people can enjoy it and that they can feel identified with the story and characters.
